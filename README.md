# cards_workspace

Some cards were supposed to be full-width cards, meaning they don't share a row. These are Alternate Card and Slider Card.

cards_html/ -- each card separately
index.html -- The all in one view
index.css -- Just css from global theme, same as the style tag seen on individual cards in cards_html/

sass/ -- Sass for the cards. Change as you like for web. 

sass_deps/ -- Sass dependencies. We can change these if needed.
